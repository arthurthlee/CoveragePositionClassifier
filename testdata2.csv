t,"Aetna considers ipilimumab (Yervoy) medically necessary for the treatment of the following malignant melanomas:

As a single agent for brain metastases if active against primary tumor (melanoma) for recurrent disease; or
Adjuvant treatment as a high-dose single agent for:
stage IIIA with metastases >1 mm or stage IIIB-C disease with nodal metastases following a complete lymph node dissection with or without wide excision; or
following complete lymph node dissection and/or complete resection of nodal recurrence; or
Note: Continued use of ipilimumab for adjuvant treatment of melanoma is considered medically necessary if the member has not had disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity with ipilimumab and the total duration of treatment is less than 3 years.
 
Therapy for metastatic or unresectable disease:
in combination with nivolumab as first-line therapy; or
as a single agent or in combination with nivolumab as second-line or subsequent therapy for disease progression for persons with performance status 0-2 if not previously used (however, for persons who progress on single-agent checkpoint immunotherapy, nivolumab/ipilimumab combination therapy is considered medically necessary); or
as a single agent or in combination with nivolumab after maximum clinical benefit from BRAF targeted therapy for persons with performance status 0-2; or 
as a single-agent or in combination with nivolumab as reinduction therapy in persons who experience disease control and have no residual toxicity but subsequently experience disease progression/relapse more than 3 months after treatment discontinuation. Note: for this indication, the member must have had stable disease, partial response or complete response for more than 3 months following completing of the initial induction (completing of four cycles within a 16-week period); reinduction is considered experimental and investigational for members who were unable to tolerate or receive the complete induction regimen within 16 weeks of initiation.  

Aetna considers ipilimumab medically necessary for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) as subsequent systemic therapy for persons with performance status 0-2 in combination with nivolumab for
relapse within 6 months following complete or partial response or stable disease with initial treatment; or
primary progressive disease.

Aetna considers ipilimumab medically necessary for malignant pleural mesothelioma as subsequent systemic therapy in combination with nivolumab.

Ipilimumab is considered experimental and investigational when used in combination with vemurafenib (Zelboraf), Tafinlar (dabrafenib) or Mekinist (trametinib) therapy because the safety and efficacy have not been established.

Aetna considers ipilimumab experimental and investigational for the treatment of the following indications (not an all-inclusive list) because its effectiveness for these indications has not been established:
Colon cancer

t,"Effective September 1, 2017, BCBS North Dakota has removed policy language regarding intermittent (office-based) use of continuous glucose monitoring from their published medical policy. Currently published medical policy addressed patient-owned CGM systems only.

Previously published coverage criteria are included below:

Intermittent (professional) monitoring (up to 72 hours) of glucose levels in interstitial fluid may be considered medically necessary in patients with Type 1 diabetes whose diabetes is poorly controlled despite current use of best practices. 

Poorly controlled diabetes includes the following clinical situations: unexplained hypoglycemic episodes, hypoglycemic unawareness, suspected postprandial hyperglycemia, and recurrent diabetic ketoacidosis.

Intermittent monitoring of glucose levels in interstitial fluid may also be considered medically necessary in patients with Type 1 diabetes prior to insulin pump initiation to determine basal insulin levels.

Women with type 1 diabetes mellitus taking insulin who are pregnant or about to become pregnant with poorly controlled diabetes are another subset of patients to whom the policy statement on intermittent monitoring may apply. 

Best practices in diabetes control for patients with insulin dependent diabetes include compliance with a regimen of 4 or more fingersticks each day and use of an insulin pump.

During pregnancy, 3 or more insulin injections daily could also be considered best practice for patients not on an insulin pump prior to the pregnancy"
t,"Use of an FDA-approved short-term (i.e., 72-hour minimum) interstitial continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) for detecting trends and patterns in glucose levels is considered medically necessary and, therefore, covered for individuals who meet one of the following criteria:

- The individual is a pregnant female with type I or type II diabetes that requires insulin therapy.
- The individual has type I diabetes and requires determination of basal insulin level measurements prior to insulin pump initiation.
- The individual has type I or type II diabetes and documentation of all of the following:
- The individual has received diabetes self-management education and instruction from a health care professional with expertise in the management of diabetes.
-  The individual has a documented average of at least three glucose self-tests per day during the previous month.
- The individual has a documented history of poorly controlled diabetes (i.e., severe ketosis or hypoglycemic episodes without experiencing warning and recognition of symptoms or hypoglycemic unawareness).
- The individual is on an intensive insulin regimen, requiring two or more insulin injections per day, or utilizes an insulin pump.
- The individual has one or more of the following while on an intensive insulin regimen: 
? Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values less than four or greater than nine
? Unexplained large fluctuations in daily glucose values before meals
? Unexplained frequent hypoglycemic attacks
? Episodes of ketoacidosis or hospitalizations for significantly elevated glucose levels

Short-term interstitial CGMS monitoring must be reported only once per monitoring period, regardless of the number of days involved. Continuous interstitial glucose monitoring must be performed for a minimum of 72 hours to show glucose trends effectively.

For short-term interstitial CGMS devices, a monitoring period of less than 72 hours is considered not medically necessary and, therefore, not covered.

Short-term interstitial CGMS monitoring is intended only for periodic or occasional testing and to supplement, not replace, self-testing of blood glucose.

All other uses for a short-term interstitial CGMS are considered experimental/investigational and, therefore, not covered because their safety and/or effectiveness cannot be established by review of the available published peer-reviewed literature."
